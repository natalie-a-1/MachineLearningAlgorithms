# MachineLearningAlgorithms
**Description**
This project explores the most common algorithms in machine learning. I will practice usiing each algorithm with different python libraries on data sets retrieved from kaggle to better understand each algorithms strengths and weaknesses. 
### Linear Regression
### Logistic Regression
### Random Forest
### K Nearest Neighbors
### Decision Tree
